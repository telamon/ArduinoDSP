Arduino DSP
===========
## Update 2015-03-21

    I've been receiving a couple of emails inquiring about this project the past years,
    and I feel I should have left a few more notes in this readme.
    
    The reason to why this project has been pretty much abondoned is because the Arduino doesn't have enough
    processing-power to accomplish any realtime signal processing. 
    So after finally managing to get this project to just do a plain Audio-passthrough and realize
    the extremely bad quality and chunkyness of the sound I started looking for alternatives.
    
    The raspberry has more juice but also alot more overhead thus, I've never
    had good results with the highlevel DSP tools like jackd & rackarrack etc..
    
    The Arduino DUE might cut this cheese.
    
    But currently I've switched my attention over to the Papilio Pro, it's become a long-term project...
    I'll let you know once I have anything more for share.


Digital signal processing for the arduino.
This is my personal working project based on the original
work done by Kyle McDonald

The circuits I use are almost identical to Kyle's will have to document
them later.
